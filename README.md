# smsbroadcast
work sms broadcast program broke, bashed something up in go while we investigate to continue operations as normal

we have a CRM released in 1974 and a plugin for it written in house to make reqs to an sms broadcast api,
the only thing is we dont have the source code for the plugin and its written in .net 3.5 haha, anyways
this gets the same job done (but faster!!!)
